# pygame-Monster Room
"Monster Room" is a small game made in Python using the pygame library and OOP. 

The game involves the player (the robot sprite) trying to score points by collecting a coin which randomly changes it's cooridinates when it's touched by the player. In the meantime monster sprites are coming from the left and upper portals. If the player touches the monsters the player loses. The monster come with increasing frequency and increasing speed depending on the number of points the player has scored.
After scoring 10 points a "hunter" is spawned in the right bottom corner represented by a slow moving monster sprite that follows the player. If touched, it also leads to a loss for the player. 
The game also features a game over screen and 2 options after losing, to continue the game or exit.

The game was made as the last project of the MOOC.fi python advanced programming course offered by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.
